This is BSP version 1.5 dos extended, written by Colin Reed:
creed@graymatter.on.ca

Please send all questions about BSP to Lee Killough (killough@convex.com,
or killough@rsn.hp.com), since Colin Reed is too busy now.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Changes from 1.4x to 1.5x:

Replaced GO32.EXE with newer version, to support Windows
and DPMI.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Changes from 1.3x to 1.4x:

Lee Killough:

Fixed bug which caused BSP to "do nothing" on systems where
GO32.EXE was not in the user's path.

Added -factor option to allow changing the heuristic used by the
node picker. Factor can be any positive integer, and the larger
the factor, the more costly seg splits are. A factor of 17 is the
default and behaves just like earlier versions of BSP. Changing the
factor can sometimes prevent visplane overflows in wads. But then
again, some wads have just too many visible 2s linedefs for the
node builder to make a difference. If you have visplane overflows,
experiment with the -factor option before giving up.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Changes from 1.2x to 1.3x:

New version due to performance enchancements by Lee Killough
(killough@convex.com, or killough@rsn.hp.com).

Runs at least 3 times as fast as before, due to changes in PickNode.
Same results are obtained, but with greater speed. Differences from
1.2x:

     PickNode() rewritten to maximize performance. New PickNode()
     algorithm features pruning strategy which allows inner loop
     to exit as soon as a seg is detected as being worse than the
     best so far.

     All floating-point arithmetic inside inner loop has been eliminated.

     GetVertexes() changed and Reference() removed, replaced with a
     faster vertex renumbering algorithm which also removes lines of
     length zero.

     IsLineDefInside() tuned by eliminating bit mask variable.

     Functions are static, to reduce code size by permitting total
     inlining.

     Various other minor performance enhancements

-----------------------------------------------------------

Changes from 1.1 to 1.2x:

New version 1.2 due to bug found by Mark Harrison that caused some
problems with flipped segs having their textures buggered up.

The GO32 dos extender has been pre-pended to the executable.

-----------------------------------------------------------

This builds a BSP node tree for your DOOM wad files.

Usage:

BSP [-factor nnn] <input file> [<output file>]

If no output file is specified 'tmp.wad' is written.

-----------------------------------------------------------

This ZIP includes the fullly commented source code for all you
Doom editor/utility writers out there.

-----------------------------------------------------------

A known problem is a conflict between the GO32 dos extender
and QEMM's DPMI... put 'set GO32=nodpmi' in your autoexec.bat
to avoid problems.
