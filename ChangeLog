Fixed up a large number of memory leaks. Basically BSP was designed to do 
one level only, and the multi-level support was an afterthought. It 
did multiple levels, but memory-wise it assumed it needn't bother to 
free one level's stuff before moving on the the next. Since it's easy to 
fix, I fixed it. It's now practical to use it for multi-level PWADs.
Builds doom.wad in < 1.5megs now (as compared to 15megs before).

Added big endian support. Imported the extra code from the xwadtools 
version. I rely on autoconf to detect if the machine is big endian. 
No adverse affects on x86 - I also verified that it compiles if 
WORDS_BIGENDIAN is defined. Can't do a real test myself though.

Support for pipes and stuff was today's business. Added the isatty() 
test from the yadex version of BSP that supresses the spinning 
progress thingy when stdout is redirected.

Added support for input being from a pipe. I'm writing for UNIX damnit, 
so it ought to be usable like other UNIX programs! :-)

For input pipes, it just reads to a temp file, then reads back from the 
temp file. For output I was less sure what to do: there are 3 
senarios:

1) output to a file that either doesn't exist, or can be overwritten in any 
 case.
2) output to a file which we only want overwritten once the build is complete 
 and sucessful (e.g. writing the output back to the input filename)
3) output to a pipe

For (3), we need to write to a temp file then copy to the pipe, because 
we have to be able to fseek(3) on the output file to write a Doom WAD.
For (2), we need to write to a temp file then copy to the output when 
we're done.

In the end, I went for an easy compromise. If the output file already 
exists (includes the case of a pipe), then we write the WAD to a temporary 
file, then copy it to the real output file once we're done. That copes 
with (2) and (3) fine.

Made a makefile to built the test wads. I copied the test WADs to another 
machine, and ran original DOS BSP 3.0 on them, then made a note of the MD5 
sums of the resulting files. Using these I can check that my version is still 
producing identical results to the original v3.0.

Checked in the BSP 3.0 source. Immediately ditched the existing makefiles and 
created GNU autoconf/automake ones - much less messy.

First major problem to overcome was the crude existing build system - all the 
.c files were #include'd into bsp.c, which was kinda ugly. And whoever wrote 
this had an obsession with labelling everything "static" even though there was 
only one source file. Fun.
